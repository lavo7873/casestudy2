            <p class="about-info-desc">Anime  is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. 
                Outside of Japan and in English, anime refers to Japanese animation, and refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.
                However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works, 
                regardless of style or origin.
